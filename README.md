# INTERN-FRONTEND-WEB3-SUBMISSION

This is a simple Next.js application that allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, view their wallet address, and check their Ethereum (ETH) balance. The app uses a backend API to fetch the user's ETH balance based on the provided wallet address.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).
